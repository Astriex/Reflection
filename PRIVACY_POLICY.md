## Reflection: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Reflection app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Melis Huskanovic. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have programmed this app to collect only the data necessary for its basic features. Username, email and password are needed for account creation to be able to save data outside of the device the app is installed on. Photos added as a note background. 

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Melis Huskanovic.
